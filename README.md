## This Fork
### What is it for?
This fork exists solely to allow r2modman to mod games that are not through any one launcher.  (For those who may be concerned, the purpose of this fork is not to assist in piracy.) 
### Will it get additional features?
I do not know any of the programming languages that this project utilizes, and I do not have a very good understanding of Git. I will not be maintaining this fork apart from adding support for new games and merging changes from upstream. 
### I got an error in r2modman after closing out a game, what is that about?
You might run into an error in r2modman whenever closing a game after it being opened through r2modman. As far as I know, this error does not affect anything.
### How do I add a non-launcher game?
To add a non-launcher game, simply select it in the game selection menu, select other, select your profile, go to settings, and then point the "Change (Game Name Here) directory" setting to your game directory.
### How do I download it?
To download it, go to releases and download the applicible executable for your operating system. If you're on Windows, it will be the exe files. If you're on MacOS, you download the zip with Mac in its name and maybe the dmg file, I don't really know anything about MacOS. If you're on Linux, you download either an AppImage, Pacman, tar.gz, rpm, or deb. The one download depends on your distrubtion and what it is derived from.
### Who do I report an issue to?
Most likely the original r2modman. Apart from the readme and the GitHub actions workflow file, the only file I amended was the file that handles the game list.
### My game isn't supported!
If you cannot add a game as other, then I probably have not amended the code since that game was added. Wait for me to update it, or feel free to submit a pull request.

## What is a mod manager?
It's quite simple really, a mod manager is an application to make it easier to control which mods you have installed.

You can choose to update, enable/disable or even uninstall mods with a simple click, all whilst keeping it available on another profile.

## Installing

### First time installing
#### Windows
1. Click "Manual Download" on Thunderstore.
2. Inside the downloaded **.zip** file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X.X.X is the current version).
3. Follow the steps in the installer.

#### Linux
1. Click "Manual Download" on Thunderstore.
2. Inside the download **.zip** file there is an AppImage release.

**If you'd prefer to install platform specific builds then you can find them under the latest GitHub release on the ebkr/r2modmanPlus repository**

**Platform builds:**
 - deb
 - rpm
 - pacman
 - tar.gz

 _Problems with Linux builds should be reported in the [r2modman discord](https://discord.gg/jE2zWHY)._

##### Note
- Temporary workaround to force Proton on Linux systems
    - Place a `.forceproton` file in the game directory whilst a solution is in development

### Updating
r2modman will automatically download any available updates whilst you use it.

If an update has been downloaded, it will be installed once you have closed the application.

## Help

## Feedback and suggestions
It's encouraged to provide as much feedback as you'd like, and fully open to criticism.

Suggestions are welcome and there are already some suggestions that have made it in to the manager!
From small features such as always-expanded cards, all the way to larger features such as code-based profile exports.

The only thing you have to consider when suggesting a feature is the impact it will have on users who don't have a lot of experience with computers.
